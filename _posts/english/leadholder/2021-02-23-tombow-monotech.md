My first Japanese leadholder. Tombow Monotech 2.0mm.

# Tombow Monotech 2.0

[Tombow](tombow.com), one of the biggest stationery company in Japan, is well known for its quality. "TOMBOW develops products that redefine the traditional uses of stationery and seek to offer the customer excitement and satisfaction." according to [TOMBOW Homepage](tombow.com/en/brands). Personally I love Tombow's pencils, leadholder and other stationery stuffs. Monotech 2.0mm leadholder is one of them. Let's take a look.

# Design

Apart from thin and sleeky style other leadholders, **Tombow Monotech 2.0mm** has a sexy design. Namely, it's out-of-box design for leadholder. It has a 'thick sleeve' unique clip and hardness indicator. Knurling in grip is also awesome. I think Tombow company loves to make these provacative design.

# Components Disassemble

The way Monotech disassembled is different from other leadholders. In general, unscrewing by rotating a 'clutch' is a way to disassemble leadholder. I tried that with Monotech, but didn't work. To disassemble it, you need to rotate grip part. Clutch has no screw but attached directly to 'shaft'.

# Two Springs in One Leadholder?

Surprisingly two springs are attached to a single leadholder. Also, unlike other leadholders those two springs are located near the 'grip'. (between grip and sleeve) In my point, it seems that it's just enough to use a single springs, but Tombow didn't. Maybe it's easier to design in that wise.

# Lead Hardness Indicator

The most impressive point of **Tombow Monotech** is the design of **Lead Hardness Indicator**. It's really eye-catching. That straightfoward design is quite extraordinary. By turning the Gear-shaped indicator, you can mark the hardness of 2.0mm lead. Tick-Tick sound when turning indicator makes me feel good.

# Classfication of Vintage Versions

It seems that the versions of Monotech is divided by the color of grip. When Google **'Monotech 2.0mm'** you can find two versions. One grip is silver and the other is black. According to ebay sellers or worthpoint.com, the black version was produced in 1980s, and the siver in 1990s. Check the link below.

Clutch holding the lead. 'Sleeve' is rectangular-shaped, so turning it (as we use pencils) is impossible. It's recommended to use hard leads (H 2H 3H...) which don't become bulnt easily.

# Original Built-in Lead (10x loupe)

Original built-in lead is 'Tombow HB 2.0mm lead'. X1 or Xl is written on the lead, but can't find any informations about it. The length is soooooooo long that non of leadholder, except Tombow Monotech, can contain this lead.

This lead is so soft in that it feels like B or 2B. Not recommended for writing. (For drawing it would be okay.) In general, Japanese pencils are usally soft than Europe/American pencils. For example, Faber Castell 9000 HB pencil hardness is similar to Tombow Mono J 2H~3H pencils. I guess it is same for leadholders too.

# Metal Stopper attached to original-lead

Metal is attached to original-lead. It's called stopper, which prevents the lead fall from leadholder. Many vintage lead has stopper on it. Unfortunately recently-produced-leadholders can't use stopper-attached-lead.
cf) Recently made Caran d'Ache Fixpenil can use stopper-attached-lead. It's because it has shaft which diameter is quite big.
